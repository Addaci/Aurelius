meane time using all possible diligence, and making all the sayle they could
to escape from them; in which pursuite the said french Captaine caused
7. peeces of Ordnance to be discharged with bullets att or against the
said shipp ''fortunes''. The premisses this deponent well knoweth being an
Eye witnesse of and acting therein.

To the third hee saith, That the said ffrenchmen of warr closely pursuing
the said shipp ''fortune'', and there being not any probability of her escape
from thence, or recovereing any Port of fflanders, shee steered her Course
towards the Coast of England, the Master and Company of her, (as this deponent
is fully convinced) hoping and intending to gett under the protection of some
shipp or shipps of warr in the service of this Commonwealth, during all which
fflight the said frenchmen of warr incessantly pursued and made after the
sayd shipp ''fortune'', and were readie to have Laid her aboard, and taken her
and her Ladeing. The premisses hee knoweth upon the grounds of knowledge
predeposed. And further cannot depose&amp;#58;-/

To the 4th article hee saith, That during the said fligght, pursuite and
discharge of Ordnance by the said frenchmen of warr against the said
shipp ''fortune'', and English frigatt in the immediate service of this
Commonwealth rideing at an anchor neere dover, weighed anchor

having spoken with the french Captaines, and understanding they were in
pursuite of the said shipp ''fortune'' as being a Shipp bound with her
Lading to some of their enemies Ports in fflanders the said English
frigatt left them, the Officers thereof bidding them pursue their Prize
which they did, and shortly after another English friggat came up to
them, when the said frenchmen of warr were ready to have boarded and
taken the said shipp ''fortune'', and were but about a muskett shott
distance from her, but the said English frigatt discharging two
Gunns, the said frenchmen of warr in obediance to her lowred their
sailes, and attended her coming up, and the said friggatt being so come
up immediately sent men aboard the said shipp ''fortune'', and became
possessed of her and her ladeing, thereby depriveing and divesting the
french of the same. The premisses hee well knoweth, being an
Eyewittnesse thereof&amp;#58;-

To the 5th article hee saith, That the aid shipp ''fortune'' passing so close to
the Coast of ffrance when first espyed and pursued by the said french
men of warr, had in all probability passed free and
undiscovered by the English, in case shee had not beene so chased, and
in the chase steered her Course towards the Coast of England aforesaid
the french coast being now the usuall course of shipps bound from france
to fflanders purposely to prevent seizure by the English, And so much hee
saith is well knowne to a Mariner useing and acquainted with that
Navigation.

To the 6th hee saith, That in Case the said English friggat had not, as
predeposed, come up and retarded the ffrench, and putt men aboard the
said shipp ''fortune'', the said frenchmen of warr had immediately
boarded and taken her and her lading it being impossible shee should
have escaped them being at the distance predeposed, and then &amp;#91;?retarded GUTTER&amp;#93;

To the third Article hee saith, That there being noe visible probabilitie
that the said shipp ''fortune'' should escape from the said two frenchmen of
warr, nor recover Dunquirke or any other Port of fflanders, (being so closely pursued) the
Master and Companie of the said shipp ''fortune'' steered their Course towards
the Coast of England, intending, as this deponent in Conscience is most firmely
assured, to gett under the protection of some English shipp or shipps of
warr, the said frenchmen of warr still pursueing, and comeing neare to
the said shipp ''fortune'' in a readinesse to have layd her aboarde and taken
her and her lading, The premisses hee declareth upon the grounds of
knowledge and conviction in Conscience aforesaid. And further
cannot depose./

To the 4th hee saith, That during the said pursuite and upon discharge of
severall gunns as predeposed, an English frigatt rideing at anchor neere
or in Dover roade weighed anchor and made up towards them; and the Officers thereof haveing
spoken both to the Captaines of the said frenchmen of warr, and to the
Master of the said shipp fortune, and being informed that the said shipp
''fortune'' was poursued by them in order to take her and her lading, as belonging
to the enemies of the Crowne of ffrance and bound for fflanders the said
frigat without any opposition departed and returned for the roade of
Dover, and another English frigat in the immediate service of this
Commonwealth comeing from the Westward of England and dischargeing two
gunns, the said frenchmen of warr in obeisance and respect to her
lowered their sailes just as they were within muskett shott or thereabouts
from the said shipp fortune, and readie to have boarded and taken her,
of which lowring their sayles the said English frigat takeing the oportunity
sent men aboard the said shipp fortune, who possessed themselves of her
and her lading, and brought them for England depriving the said
frenchmen of warr thereof. The premisses hee well knoweth
being present at the same in the condition predeposed./

To the 5th hee saith, That the said shipp ''fortune'' according to the Course shee
shaped when first discovered as aforesaid, was undoubtedly bound for
Dunquirke or some other Port of Spanish fflanders shee then being neere
unto the Coast of ffrance which is the usuall Course of shipps bound
from france for fflanders doe take during hostility betweene England and
Spaine, thereby the better to escape the being discovered and seized by
the English, so that in all probability the said shipp ''fortune'', if shee had
not bin pursued as aforesaid, had passed undiscovered by the English, and
had attained her desired port in fflanders The premisses hee declareth
upon the grounds before expressed, and for that being a seafareing person
and accustomed, to the coast aforesaid hee is to the coast aforesaid well versed in the fflandrian practizes in order to their
security in such cases. And further cannot depose./

To the 6th hee saith, That in case the said shipp ''fortune'' and lading
had not bin boarded and taken as they were by the said English
friggatts Companie, the said two frenchmen of warr were in a
readinesse immediately to have boarded and taken them, they the
being at about a muskett shott distance from her, and, without any

Browning severall dayes on shoare about his shipps busines, And
otherwise hee cannot depose.

To the Interrogatories. &amp;#91;CENTRE HEADING&amp;#93;

To the first hee saith hee cometh in the instance of the said Thomas
Browning to speake the truth in this cause, and that hee hath noe
relation at all to him; and saith hee this deponent sawe the said
Browning severall times in the house of the interrate Mr Wilson in
Cadiz about the shipps business, and that this rendent was not in her
that voyage, And otherwise hee cannot depose.

To the second hee saith that as hee hath heard the said Thomas
Browning had an Adventure of his owne on board the said shipp
the said voyage, and this deponent holdeth the said allowance of
a peece of eight per day in the case aforesaid to be a duety from the
owners and not a gratuitie, in as much as a master or purser cannot
well be at lesse daily expense on
shoare; and hee doth not conceive that the owners having a factor
on shoare shall not excuse the said allowance, for a master is seldome
or never consigned to a port, where&amp;#91;?in&amp;#93; the owners have not some
factor or other person to give him assistance and that the masters
going ashoare to him and staying there and waiting on him about
the shipps business is for the most part equall expense to him as if there were noe
factor there, and that rate of a peece of eight per diem is a
mans ordinary expense there, and often more than lesse. And
otherwise cannot answere saving as aforesaid.

on the sayd voyage shee had aboard her a great quantitie of
burr shott, and only two peeces of ordinance and seaven musketts, and a good
quantitie of muskett shott and about nyne or tenn great shott and about two and thirty pounds of powder which
was a proportionable quantitie as hee beleeveth to the sayd gunnes musketts and
shott and sufficient for the voyage aforesayd as hee beleeveth And further
to this article hee cannot depose. saving hee saith the master of her procured about
tenn or twelve great shott more at ffoy in Cornwall./or ffalmouth/.

To the 2&amp;#58; 3 and 4th articles of the sayd allegation hee this deponent
hee being gunner of and aboard the ''Prosperous'' till, and at her seizure, which
happened the first day of June last, well knoweth the sayd shipp ''Prosperous''
came from Burdeaux in ffrance homeward bound in Company of a yarmouth
vessell whereof the arlate Appleby was Commander who had in his sayd
shipp three gunnes, and saith the said Appleby perceiving that the ''Prosperous''
and his shipp were chased or pursued by a man of warr, spake to
the Master and Company of the ''Prosperous'' and told them that hee perceived
they were persued by a man of warr and that in likelyhood either
the ''Prosperous'' or this shipp must bee taken, and therefore advised them
to looke to them selves for hee intended to leave them or to that effect, and thereupon
his the sayd Applebyes shipp being the better sayler hee went away
and left the ''Prosperous'' to grapple with the sayd man of warr as well
as shee could, and hee being gone the sayd man of warr (which afterwards
appeared to bee a Brest man of warr) made up neerer to the ''Prosperous''
and saith the arlate Tompkins seeing her drawe neere, advised the
Master of the ''Prosperous'' to call out for quarter and sayd it was to noe
purpose to resiste for that it appeared plainely (as indeed it did to
this deponent and the Master and Company of the ''Prosperous'') that the sayd
man of warr had fower gunnes, and betweene forty and fifty men
which appeared upon the decke, and the ''Prosperous'' of this deponents knowledge had but two gunnes and
sixe or seaven men and a boy, which notwithstanding the Master of
the ''Prosperous'' being desyrous if possible to save his sayd shipp
and goods did make resistanse and caused his gunnes and severall musketts to be severall
tymes fyred against the man of warr, but this deponent and
others of the Company observing that the sayd man of warr
was come up close to the ''Prosperous'' and likely presently to enter
her quarter desyred the Master of her to call for quarter and withall
the Company threw downe their Musketts and lowered their Top saile,
which the master perceiving did aske quarter and soe the sayd shipp
''Prosperous'' not being able to make further resistanse was taken
one of her gunnes being then laden, and some powder left, but
saith hee well knoweth the sayd shipp &amp;#123;and&amp;#125; goods was not lost through
any want of powder or ammunition but meerely by reason shee
was over powered with multitude of men who were ready
from the sayd man of warr to enter her quarter and shee being
a smale pinke which carried no gunnes behinde could not possibly
though her whole ladeing of had consisted of powder and shott have
made any resistanse more than shee did, And further to theise
articles hee cannot depose./

the sayd dammage so done and same and knoweth the quality of the goods so
dammified and is well assured that the said Pilot had he done his duty might
have prevented the sayd dammage, by putting into the Channell &amp;#91;XXX XXXX XXX GUTTER&amp;#93;
served well for that purpose att that tyme, and another shipp which
was a head of the ''Exchange'' did safely putt into the Channell att that
tyme, and escaped that danger which the ''Exchange'' by not altering
her course rann into; And otherwise he cannot depose.

To the 8th article he cannot depose.

To the 9th he saith he referres himselfe to the Acts and words of the Court.

To the 10th he saith the sayd Waring is generally reputed to be an
Englishman and subject to the Jurisdiction of this Court

To the last he saith his foregoeing deposition is true.

To the Crosse Interrogatories &amp;#91;CENTRE HEADING&amp;#93;

To the 1st Interrogatories he saith that the sayd James Warren hath had the repute
of a sufficient Pilot to conduct a shipp out of this River into the downes
and accordingly hath pilotted severall shipps as that Rendent hath heard
And further having not had any personall knowledge of the sayd Warren
or Experience of his Pilotting before the voyage in question he cannot
answer

To the second Interrogatorie he saith the said James Warren did Pilot the said shipp
and brought her safely to Gravesend, and she was there cleared upon a
Saturday, and the same Saturday might as he now remembreth or the next
morning she was unmoved in order to fall downe to the Hope. And att that
tyme the wind was very high, howbeit other shipps as well of the ''Exchange''
then likewise departed from Gravesend, and the said Warren Pilotted the
''Exchange'' into the Hope without difficulty so farr as this Rendent
observed. And further knowing nothing of the interrogat passages
betwixt the sayd Wilkinson and Warren, he cannot depose.

To the third Interrogatorie he saith that the shipp ''Exchange'' was of about two
hundred tonnes burthen and twenty four men are a competent number
to sayle such a shipp upon such a voyage as was then intended and
that there were twenty four men as Mariners in the sayd shipp ''Exchange''
the tyme in question, besides two boyes all being of her company. And &amp;#91;?that GUTTER&amp;#93;
otherwise not remembering to have heard the sayd Warren to have compl&amp;#91;?ained GUTTER&amp;#93;

or force used to the said Warren to sayle out of the Hope, he saith &amp;#91;?hee GUTTER&amp;#93;
cannot answere.

To the 4th Interrogatorie he saith that the sayd shipp being upon her sayd voyage
departed from the Hope (to the best of his remembrance) upon a Sunday morning
next after the fore mentioned Saturday, and sayling by the Redsand  &amp;#91;?were GUTTER&amp;#93;
over the fflatts that morning, and att that tyme there blew a very strong
wind from the North west and By west, but the sayd shipp came not to the &amp;#91;XX GUTTER&amp;#93;
narrow nor did edge in as is pretended by this Interrogatorie, but Äame &amp;#91;?neare GUTTER&amp;#93;
to the Woollpack which is out of the narrow, and there struck and left &amp;#91;?her GUTTER&amp;#93;
rudder, after the losse whereof the said shipp beat over that sand
and then cast anchor but not lyeing safely thene, but beating upon
another saw the Cables were of necessity to be cutt, and so the shipp &amp;#91;XX GUTTER&amp;#93;
over that other sands; And he saith it is true that the said Warren did steare &amp;#91;XXX GUTTER&amp;#93;
South East for the Redsand, and did afterwards and after that he &amp;#91;?had GUTTER&amp;#93;
mist or left his Course to the narrow whither he should have gone, &amp;#91;?endeavoure GUTTER&amp;#93;

lost her rudder and was damnified as aforesayd. As for the importunity or force
interrogated, or that the sayd Warren did putt the helme a port, or the sayd

Warren is in this Interrogatory pretended to have endeavoured to bring together.
And further he cannot depose.

To the 5th. he saith the sayd shipp having beat over the sayd Woollpacke came into
three fathom and a halfe water, and then her sayles were furled, and both her
yards and topmast struck, and her two bower anchors cast out, and the wind was
high and her anchors yeilded and gave way, so as the sayd shipp struck agayne
on another sand, and then her sheat Ã¡nchors were cutt as aforesayd, and she beat over
that other sand, and then her sheat Ã¡nchor was cast out, and the wind increa=
sing the sayd sheat Ã¡nchor was cutt in the flood, and the shipp was forced to

who was in fault thereof he referreth himselfe to his foregoeing deposition

|Transcription=Kinge of Spaine as by Charterparty aforesayd doth appeare, And the sayd voyage being by this deponent
performed the sayd Travers hath in persuance of the Conditions of the sayd Charterparty by him selfe and by his order paid
this deponent a good part of the freight due for the sayd voyage in question according
to the sayd rates and is lyable as this deponent beleeveth to pay the remaynder
of the same, And saith the sayd And further saving his subsequent deposition
hee cannot depose/

To the 4th 5th and 6th articles of the sayd allegation hee saith hee well knoweth the arlate
Robert Bevin and that hee was and is factor for the sayd Gyles Travers at Teneriff, and
verily beleeveth that by reason of an Imbargo made by the King of Spaine upon all shipps
and goods of English merchants within his power in the yeere 1655 the factors of the English Merchants at Teneriff
in the sayd yeere while the English shipps laye in the Roade of Oratavo or neere
the Ilands of Teneriff did in behalfe of their principalls and the better to procure ladeing
for their shipps then there that they might not returne home empty give or pay a summe
of money unto the generall and officers of the sayd Island for admission money
to lade wines under colour and pretence of being for Account of dutch merchants And the reason of such
his beleefe is for that the sayd Bevin factor to the sayd Travers (with whose hand
writing this deponent is well acquainted) did write unto this deponent
then lying with his sayd shipp in the Roade of Oratava a letter bearing date the twenty
seaventh of November 1655 (new style) therein signifying to this effect that hee had paid in the
behalfe of his Principall the sayd Mr Travers a summe of money for admission
money for the whole ladeing of the shipp the ''John and Mary'' aforesayd, and that
according to Computation it amounted to fiftie eight Ryalls for each pipe of
wine laden aboard the sayd shipp ''John and Mary'', which hee was forced to do that
soe the sayd wines might passe as laden for dutch merchants Accompts to &amp;#91;?avoide GUTTER&amp;#93;
the Imbargoe then upon the goods and shipps of English merchants, and further writt
that the arlate Mr Burridge was gone from Oratava to Garachico and had
not paid him the said Bevin his part of the admission money for such wines
as hee the sayd Burridge had on on board the ''John and Mary'', and that therefore
hee this deponent should forbeare to signe any bills of ladeing for the sayd
Burridge his wines, unlesse one Mr Clapham who was then aboard &amp;#91;?an GUTTER&amp;#93;
English shipp at Oratava Roade, or some other person would in behalfe of
the sayd Burridge pay fifty eight ryalls a pipe for admission money
as aforesayd, And hee saith that hee this deponent having recieved &amp;#91;XXX GUTTER&amp;#93;
sayd letter did demande of the sayd Clapham in the Roade of Oratava
fiftie eight Ryalls a pipe, for admission money, for &amp;#91;?tenn GUTTER&amp;#93;
pipes of wine aboard the ''John and Mary'', for according to the sayd Bevin &amp;#91;?his GUTTER&amp;#93;
order, which the sayd Clapham refusing to pay in behalfe of the sayd
Burridge hee this deponent refused according as the sayd Bevin &amp;#91;?had GUTTER&amp;#93;
ordered him by letters did refuse to signe any bills of lading for
sayd tenn pipes of wyne, And further to those articles hee cannot depose.

To the 7th article hee saith hee beleeveth the arlate Travers is dammified to the value of &amp;#91;?five GUTTER&amp;#93;
pounds sterling at the least by the sayd Burridge his not paying &amp;#91;XXX GUTTER&amp;#93;
to the sayd Bevin
to the use of the sayd Travers the sayd Admission &amp;#91;?money GUTTER&amp;#93;
(which at 58 Ryalls a pipe comes to at least fifteene pounds tenn shillings
sterling) which five pounds sterling profitt at the least might have bin
made thereoff in this Port of London if the same had bin paid to the sayd &amp;#91;?Bevin GUTTER&amp;#93;
and by him invested in wines and sent hither And further
to this article hee cannot depose./

and all other provisions tackle and necessaries fitting for such a voyage
which he knoweth being Carpenter of her as aforesayd. And otherwise he
saith he Äannot depose.

To the 4th article he saith that from the tyme of the sayd shipps departure from &amp;#91;?Pilloe&amp;#93;
as aforesayd for the space of five or more dayes there happened every day
Contrary winds and stormy tempestuous weather which he knoweth sailing
in the sayd shipp Carpenter of her as aforesayd. And otherwise he saith
he cannot depose.

To the 5th article he saith that about the fifth or sixth day after the sayd shipp ''Hopes''
departure from &amp;#91;?Pilloe&amp;#93; (the particular day of the moneth he remembreth not) the
wind then blowing from the South=Southwest poynt a very violent storme
happened whereby the foresayles of the sayd shipp were carryed away as is arlate
Ã¡nd the shipp receyved much water by reason of the high Seas, and she was
forced back by that tempest neere fifteene leagues towards the Pilloe
And he saith that the sayd Master and Company of the sayd shipp did what was
possible to be done for the preserving the sayd shipp and her lading, which by
Gods blessing they did preserve, and after some seven or eight dayes
came into the Sound, and the winds being still Contrary stayd there
about six or seven dayes, which he knoweth for the reasons aforesayd, and
otherwise Äannot depose.

To the 6th article he saith that the sayd shipp after six or seven dayes stay, departed
from the Sound for this Port of London and about three dayes after mett with
a &amp;#123;?most&amp;#125; violent raging storme of wind and tempest from the North North
west, which began about three of the Clock in an afternoone and continued
allnight and to the next day. during which storme the sayd shipp could beare
noe sayle saving her mainsayle which was lett downe very low, and by
three of the Clock the next morning the sayd shipp was driven upon the
Coast of Jutland neere the &amp;#91;?holmes&amp;#93;, and there being twelve fathom
water then found there were two anchors cast out one after the other
which by reason of the continued violence of the storme could take noe hold
whereupon the sayd Master and Company for preserving the sayd shipp and her lading
with their owne lives were forced and did cutt downe the maine mast of
the sayd shipp which with the yards sayles and cordage thereto belonging were
carryed overboard into the Sea, and perished and were lost; And then and
not before the sayd anchors caught fast hold, and there the sayd shipp lay &amp;#91;?till GUTTER&amp;#93;

And then the sayd Master and Company to preserve shipp, lading, and their lives
were forced and did Cutt one of their Cables, and one of the anchors did breake
in weighing, and both anchors were lost, onely one peice of one anchor
was haled upp with the cable fastned to the sayd broken anchor&amp;#58; This done the
sayd Master and Company sett sayle for the Coast of Norway to preserve their shipp &amp;#91;?if ?it GUTTER&amp;#93;

a fisherman whom they by chance found conducted them into Gasthaven in
Norway. The premisses he knoweth to be true seeing and well remem=

To the 7th article he saith that by the great violence of the sayd Storme and rage of
the sea the sayd shipp received in much water, inso much as there was great danger
of having her swallowed upp in the Sea, by the high Seas that fell upon her
oftentymes. And the sayd Master and Company did all that was possible for men to &amp;#91;?doe GUTTER&amp;#93;

after their perishing. And this deponent for his part doth verily beleive
that in case the sayd shipp had not bene a strong stanch and able shipp, or in case
her Master and Company had not shewed their labour and diligence as aforesayd
the sayd shipp and all her lading in her had perisht and bene lost by the
extreme violence of the sayd tempest. And otherwise he cannot depose.

To the eighth article hee saith that the sayd great mast yards Ropes and tackle, and
sayd Cable and Anchor were lost as aforesayd for preservation of the sayd shipp and
her lading which he knoweth for the reasons aforesayd. And the sayd mast and
other the sayd particulars so lost were in his judgment of the value of four
hundred and sixty six dollars or thereabouts, and that then like cannot be bought
for a lesser sume of money. And he conceyveth that the sayd losse ought to be
borne betwixt the sayd shipp and lading in a rateable proportion. And otherwise he cannot depose.

To the ninth and tenth articles hee saith that the sayd shipp being so brought to G&amp;#91;?a&amp;#93;sthaven
could not depart to performe her voyage till she was provided of a mast yards
and other necessaries such as were lost. And none being to be had att Gasthaven
of the sayd Master was forced and did goe to Christian=Saint to provide the same and
there bought a mast, yards two anchors with cordage and some sayles such as hee
could there procure for which (as upon his returne he did affirme and as this
deponent beleiveth he payd about three hundred Rijx dollars, and could not gett
the same cheaper. And he saith that being there in a strange place and having
not money sufficient to pay for the sayd tackle and necessaries he the sayd Master was
forced and did borrow seventy Dollars of the Mariners of his Company&amp;#58; and allso
twenty five dollars of one Evert Penniake a Master of a shipp then att Christian
Sant (as the sayd Master upon his returne from &amp;#91;XXXXX&amp;#93; to Gastaven affirmed) and as this deponent
beleiveth. And this deponent knoweth that (he the sayd Master (still wanting
moneyes to pay for the sayd things) did take a bundle of hempe out of the sayd
shipp being one of the thirty marked as aforesayd, and he (as he sayd) sold the
same for about 80 dollars and could not gett more for the same, five of which dollars
(as he also sayd) were spent in satisfying the Customes and other dutyes for the sayd
bundle of hempe. And the rest together with some of his owne money
and the moneyes borrowed as aforesayd making in all (as he sayd) about three
hundred dollars, were payd for the sayd mast sayles anchors and necessaries above
mentioned. And the sayd mast was brought a board and sett upp and other the sayd tackle
fitted for the performing of the sayd voyage of the sight and certayne knowledge
of this deponent Carpenter in and of the ''Hope'' as aforesayd. And otherwise
he cannot depose.

To the xith article he saith that the sayd shipp necessarily lay att Gusthaven about six
or seaven weekes to be fitted for her sayd voyage, and then departed and meeting
with crosse winds was forced to putt into fflackery in Norway and there to
stay about eight dayes, and setting sayle from thence for London was by
contrary winds forced to putt into Newcastle, whither she came about
three weekes before Christmas last and this deponent in her, whereby he
knoweth the premisses to be true. And otherwise he cannot depose

To the xijth and xiijth articles he saith that the sayd Barnhide did att Newcastle hire
a pilot by name John Holland to Pilot the sayd shipp to London, and the sayd Pilot
came on board and though the winds were crosse yet after some dayes conducted
the sayd shipp and lading (the sayd bundle of hempe sold att Christian sant excepted)
safe to Harwich, whither being come there was a man of Warr called
the ''Hare=pinke'' which as was there sayd used to Convoy shipps to London, and

to Convoy her, whereupon the Master of the ''Hope'' for avoyding the Dunkirke frigots
and for Company did assent to goe with them, and so stayed not att Harwich
but departed for London with the sayd pilott still on board, And it was in a morning
and the ''Hare'', Ketch and hoy lead the way and the ''Hope'' followed them. And in

To the 15th and 16th articles he saith that the sayd ''Hare pinke'' soone after she came
upon the sayd Sands brake in peices and was lost, and her Company having but
a small boat and having about thirty two men on board endeavoured to gett the
boat of the ''Hope'', which the Master and Company of her would not part with

Company of the ''Hope'' together with four of the ''Hares'' Company that had
gotten into their boat did in the same boat gett to shoare, And otherwise
he cannot depose saving that the sayd shipp ''Hope'' had taken in much water
upon the sayd sands before her Master and Company went ashoare as aforesayd

To the 17th. and 18th articles he saith that the sayd shipp came upon the sayd sands about fower
leagues from the shoare, and there was noe towne neere to the place, and only one
poore howse whither the sayd four persons of the Pinkes Company and the Master and Com
pany of the ''hope'' came about midnight, and they enquired for helpe to gett their
shipp from the Sands but could heare of none, but within a day or two heard that
some fishermen had gotten the ''Hope'' from the Sands and that she was gone for London
whither the sayd Barnhide this deponent and other his mates went to find her And
he saith That att the tyme of the sayd disaster upon the sands all the foresayd goods
laden as aforesayd att Quinsburgh were on board the sayd shipp, and came after

Examined upon the sayd allegation.

'''2'''

'''Gabriel Smell''' of Lubeck Mariner late Steersman of the sayd shipp
the ''Hope'' aged thirty yeares or thereabouts a witnes sworne Ã¡nd
examined saith as followeth.

To the first and second Articles of the sayd allegation, This deponent saith, that about the tyme
arlate there were laden on board the sayd shipp the ''Hope'' att Quinsburgh arlate
two and thirty bundles of hempe, one hundred of wainscott, one hundred
of pipe=boards, five hundred and one halfe of Clapboard, twelve hundred and
an halfe keeven staves, keepe pipe staves and three hundred and
an half of Oares, all to be transported to London for severall English
merchants att a freight agreed by their Correspondents or factors
at Quinsbourgh, The Premisses he came to know being Steersman of the sayd
shipp this voyage. And further he cannot depose.

To the 3rd. 4th and 5th Interrogatories he saith That the sayd shipp the &amp;#91;#&amp;#93;

&amp;#91;LH MARGIN&amp;#93; &amp;#91;#&amp;#93; &amp;#91;XXXXX was a strong
&amp;#91;and well provided&amp;#93;
&amp;#91;GUTTER XXXXX cables
&amp;#91;GUTTER XXXX and tackle
&amp;#91;GUTTER XXXX XXXXX
&amp;#91;GUTTER XXX And&amp;#93;
&amp;#91;GUTTER XX XXXX&amp;#93; &amp;#91;SIGNATURE, LH MARGIN&amp;#93;

departed with her sayd lading
from the &amp;#91;?Pilloa&amp;#93; soone after the beginning of September, and mett with excee=
ding bad weather and Crosse winds in the East sea which continued many dayes
and was often tempestuous so as in one storme the sayd shipp tooke in much water lost her foresayles
and was driven many leagues backward out of her Course, but came att last
to the Sondt of denmarke and there by reason of Crosse winds stayd about
eight dayes, And then departed from thence. which he knoweth being Steirs=
man of the sayd shipp as aforesayd.

To the 6. 7. and 8th. articles. he saith that within two or three dayes after the Hopes
departure from the Sondt aforesayd she mett with a most feirce and violent storme
the wind blowing from about the Northwest poynt, wherein she was in exceeding
great danger of perishing with he lading. the winds being so high that shee
could beare noe sayle but her maine sayle, which was let downe very low. the
sayd storme he saith began in an afternoone and continued to the next day
and drawe the sayd shipp neere the Holmes not far from Jutland, and there
the water being about twelve fatham two anchors were cast out but could not gett
noe fast hold so as the Master of the sayd shipp Martyn Barnhide and Company
for preserving the sayd shipp and her lading did necessarily resolve and did
cutt downe the mainmast which with the yards sayles and tackle were by the
violence of the wind borne overboard and were lost in the sea, And the next
day after midday the wind changing and coming about thhe Southwest poynt
The sayd Barnhide and Company for preservation of the sayd shipp and
her lading were constrayned to cutt one of their cables, and as they endeavoured
to weigh upp one of their anchors the same broke in peices, so as both the sayd
Anchors were lost. onely he saith a peice of one anchor was recovered. And
then the sayd shipp sett sayle for the Coast of Norway and was att last through much
danger conducted by a ffisherman (whom by chance she mett with) into Gusthaven
arlate. And he moreover saith that by credible report which hee then heard in
Norway many shipps perished in the sayd storme, and so in all probability the
''Hope'' and her lading had done if she had not bene a very strong shipp or in case
the Master and Company of her had not used their utmost industry to preserve her, which
he saith they did as farr as was possible for men to doe. And saith allso that
the sayd mast was cutt and sayd sayles yards ropes and tackle lost, and the sayd anchor
and halfe and halfe cable likewise for preserving of the sayd shipp and lading.
the value of which things so lost he conceyveth to be about four hundred and
thirty dollers, and also beleiveth that the goods being so preserved ought to contribute
towards the sayd losse. And otherwise he cannot depose saving that in the sayd
storme the sayd shipp receyved great quantities of water into her.

in the sayd storme was of necessity to be fitted with what she lacked before shee
could proceed on her voyage for London, To which purpose the sayd Barnhide
(Gusthaven not affording such things) did goe to Christian=Sandt in Norway
and there provided a new mast which was fitted and sett upp, on board
the ''Hope'', and allso two anchors and some sayles and Cordage such as that place
afforded. And he borrowed seventy Rijx dollars of his shipps Company
towards the paying for the sayd things; and had allso some moneyes from one
&amp;#91;?Peninck&amp;#93; (but how much he knoweth not). and allso sold a bundle of hempe
for the same purpose, but for how much he  knoweth not. neyther knoweth he
what the sayd things cost. And he saith that for the fitting of the sayd shipp
seaven weekes were spent, and then she departed for London but was
forced by Crosse winds into Flackery as is allegat and there stayed
about eight dayes, and then comng for England and this Port
of London, the winds att length not favouring, did putt into Newcastle
about the beginning of december last. All which he knoweth being
of her Company as aforesayd. And otherwise he cannot depose.

To the 12. 13. 14. and 15th articles he saith that the ''hope'' stayed att Newcastle about
four dayes in which tyme the sayd Barnhide hired one Holland a pilot there
to bring the sayd shipp to London, which the sayd Holland undertooke to doe
and did after about eight dayes bring her and her lading to Harwich
whither she came in a morning and stayd not there for that there was
the ''Hare pinke'' being an English man of warr and a Ketch, and an hoy
then departing for London, and the Captaine of the sayd Pinke promising to
Convoy the ''Hope'' to her Port, the sayd Pinke, ketch, and hoy sett sayle and
lead the way, and the ''Hope'' followed them having her foresayd Pilott
still on board her, And in the afternoone &lt;u&gt;of the&lt;/u&gt; same day the sayd vessells
sayling as aforesayd came upon the Sands arlate. and the Pinke and ''Hope''
stuck fast. And the sayd Pinke within a small tyme was beaten in peices
and perished, and the ''Hope'' stuck so fast that though all possible meanes
were used she could not be gott off. thereupon the Company of the Pinke
being about thirty persons not being able to gett all safe a shoare in their
owne boat which was but small did endeavour to gett the ''Hopes'' boat which
the sayd Barnhide and Company would not part with, but, desiring to stay by
their ship to loose her if possible, kept their boat to save their owne
lives if the case should come to extremity. Of the premisses he was an eye=
witnes and otherwise cannot depose.

To the 16. and 17th. articles he saith That att length four of the ''Hare pinkes''
Company gott into the ''Hopes'' boat, and acquainted the sayd Barnhide of the danger that
might befall him if the rest of the ''Hares'' Company should take his boat from
him, saying that they did intend so to doe, whereupon the sayd Barnhide and
his Company finding their endeavours to gett their shipp off the Sands to be
fruitlesse, and being sollicited by the sayd four persons as aforesayd did with
them goe to shoare in their sayd boat. And the sayd shipp ''Hope'' before her
Master and Company so left her had receyved much water in her hold, the
Premisses he knoweth being then present aboard her. And otherwise he cannot
depose, saving that the sayd disasters happened about three leagues
from shoare, and that it was midnight before the ''Hopes'' boat with the people
in her came to shoare, and saving that there was noe towne there and but
one little howse, and that noe helpe could be heard of to gett off the sayd
shipp from the Sands, and that afterwards there was newes that some ffishermen
had gotten her loose and were carrying her for London whereupon the sayd
Barnhide and Company came up to this Port.

&lt;big&gt;'''Text formatting'''&lt;/big&gt;

The MarineLives transcription platform is built on MediaWiki, which uses wiki markup to format text.  For a guide showing how to produce italics, bold, escaped text and headings, see the [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Formatting MediaWiki page on formatting]; there are also guides for [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Links internal and external links], [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Images image embedding], [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Tables tables], and [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Lists more on lists].


----


&lt;big&gt;'''Adding footnotes'''&lt;/big&gt;

* Go into edit mode
* Insert immediately after the sentence or phrase you wish to annotate the following macro:&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This is the footnote text&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
* Replace 'This is the footnote text' with the footnote you wish to add, using the format: first name, surname, title, (place of publication, date of publication), page or folio number
* Save the page

For more information and advanced formatting, including how to add and format links within the footnote, see the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Footnotes Wikipedia help on footnotes]. This uses the same markup formatting.
